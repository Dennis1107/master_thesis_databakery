# Abstract & Problem Description
Advanced analytics is hardly used in German bakeries today. While more and more bakeries have already been collecting data for several years, they lack the expertise to draw the necessary information from it. The decision about a production program is often made on the basis of gut instinct. This work addresses this problem and shows a holistic approach to create data-driven production planning. 

By combining modern forecasting methods and optimization models, an optimal production quantity is generated. In addition, substitution effects and the problem of censored demand are taken into account. In a practical context, together with abakery from the Black Forest, the methods are applied and subsequently evaluated.
and subsequently evaluated.
